# BPO-Call-Center-Analysis

## Introduction

This report presents the results of a data analysis project aimed at identifying the causes of disputes and providing actionable strategies to solve them. The analysis was conducted for a company that offers marketing services to mid-sized companies and has been struggling with client disputes, which have resulted in a significant loss of revenue.

The report was prepared by a team of data analysts who organized their own workspace, hosted their own synchronous group meetings, and discussed their work in private chats on Discord. The team used data analytics to keep track of how well the company helps its clients improve their marketing operations, such as email marketing, website development, content creation, and others.

The report outlines the objectives of the analysis, which included identifying the processing time in which invoices are settled, the processing time for the company to settle disputes, the percentage of disputes received by the company that were lost, the percentage of revenue lost from disputes, and the country where the company reached the highest losses from lost disputes.

The report presents the data analysis goals, the steps followed to conduct the analysis, the insights generated from the analysis, and the recommended strategies to deal with disputes effectively. The report also highlights important assumptions that were made during the analysis, such as all the services provided were fully completed, the quality of the services provided is not the main driving reason for disputes, and most disputes are the result of contract technicalities or clients thinking they can get away with not paying for the services.

The report provides an exceptional analysis of the data and presents insights and recommendations that can be used by the company's top executives to resolve the issue and prevent future revenue loss.
