# BPO-Call-Center-Analysis

## Introduction

This report presents the results of a data analysis project aimed at identifying the causes of disputes and providing actionable strategies to solve them. The analysis was conducted for a company that offers marketing services to mid-sized companies and has been struggling with client disputes, which have resulted in a significant loss of revenue.

The report was prepared by a team of data analysts who worked collaboratively, utilizing tools such as SQL (PostgreSQL) and Microsoft Excel to analyze the data. The team had a great time and maintained effective communication throughout the project.

The report outlines the objectives of the analysis, which included identifying the processing time in which invoices are settled, the processing time for the company to settle disputes, the percentage of disputes received by the company that were lost, the percentage of revenue lost from disputes, and the country where the company reached the highest losses from lost disputes.

The report presents the data analysis goals, the steps followed to conduct the analysis, the insights generated from the analysis, and the recommended strategies to deal with disputes effectively. The report also highlights important assumptions that were made during the analysis, such as the belief that the disputes are not primarily caused by the quality of services provided, but rather by contract technicalities or clients attempting to avoid payment.

The report provides an exceptional analysis of the data and presents insights and recommendations that can be used by the company's stakeholders to resolve the issue and prevent future revenue loss.

## Problems
- The company has been facing client disputes resulting in a significant annual loss in revenue.
